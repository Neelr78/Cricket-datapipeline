# 🏏 Cricket Data Pipeline with Airflow & Google Cloud Storage

This project demonstrates a simple but effective data pipeline using [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) to automate the retrieval and storage of cricket player rankings data.

## 🚀 Overview

The DAG (`pipeline.py`) fetches ODI batsmen rankings daily from the [Cricbuzz API](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/cricbuzz-cricket) and uploads the data to a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket in CSV format.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Apache Airflow
- Python
- Google Cloud Storage
- RapidAPI (Cricbuzz API)

## 🛠️ Features

- Scheduled to run daily (`@daily`)
- Uses PythonOperator to execute custom Python logic
- Retrieves data from a public API
- Saves rankings into a temporary CSV
- Uploads the file to GCS automatically
- Includes retry and timeout configurations


## 📦 Requirements

- Airflow
- Google Cloud SDK
- `google-cloud-storage` Python package
- `requests` Python package

Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install google-cloud-storage requests apache-airflow
